      "The video begins with the speaker, CA Rachana Ranade, introducing an IPO summary video for LG Electronics India Limited. She starts by asking a trivia question about the full form of LG, revealing it was \"Lucky Goldstar\" and later became simply \"LG,\" with \"Life's Good\" being the company's slogan.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then shares an update about her \"Har Ghar Investor\" Hyderabad event, extending an early bird offer due to high demand. She highlights key discussion points for the seminar, including fundamental analysis with AI tools, her Nifty target, new investment opportunities, and whether ₹1 crore is enough for retirement. The seminar will also feature a Q&A session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranade then delves into LG Electronics India Limited's operations, explaining that the company manufactures and sells home appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, water purifiers, dishwashers, microwave ovens, compressors, motors) and home entertainment products (televisions, audio devices, monitors, projectors, information displays). She clarifies that they operate in both B2C (Business-to-Consumer) and B2B (Business-to-Business) segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyzing the revenue split for 2025, she shows that home appliances and air solutions contribute approximately 75% of the revenue, while home entertainment accounts for about 25%. Within home appliances, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners each contribute roughly 20-27%, indicating a diversified product portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding geographical revenue, 94% comes from domestic sales, with a small portion from Africa and negligible sales from America and Europe. This means the company is largely unaffected by US tariffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then discusses LG's manufacturing and distribution presence in India, noting two manufacturing units in Noida and Pune, supported by two central distribution centers, 23 regional distribution centers, 51 branch offices, and over 30,000 sub-dealers. The production volume and capacity utilization are higher in Noida than in Pune, suggesting potential future capital expenditure if demand continues to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to key risks, Ranade identifies:\n",
      "1. **Raw Material Costs:** Purchases of raw materials constitute about 75% of the company's revenue from operations, making profitability vulnerable to raw material price increases.\n",
      "2. **Manufacturing Facilities:** Having only two manufacturing units (Noida and Pune) poses a risk; any disruptions or stoppages at these facilities could adversely impact the business.\n",
      "3. **Market Share:** LG's market share in key product categories (refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, televisions) has shown a continuous decrease from 2022 to 2025. This, combined with the highly competitive landscape in the electronics and appliances market, is a significant concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite a growing industry (7% CAGR from 2019-2024, projected to accelerate to 11% CAGR from 2024-2029) and positive financial growth (revenue CAGR of 10.67%, EBITDA CAGR of 28.1%, PAT CAGR of 27.84% from FY22-23 to FY24-25), the declining market share is a red flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, she addresses the valuation, comparing LG's post-IPO P/E ratio of 37.6 with industry peers. While LG boasts higher revenue from operations, better EBITDA, PAT, ROCE, and RONW compared to many peers, its P/E ratio is lower than the industry average (56.49) and even lower than the highest peer (65.59). However, it's higher than the lowest peer (43.53). This implies that, based on current metrics, the company might be considered undervalued compared to the broader industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPO, entirely an Offer for Sale (OFS) of ₹11,607.01 crores (meaning no funds will go to the company, only to selling shareholders), is open from October 7-9, 2025, with a price band of ₹1,080 to ₹1,140 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranade concludes by asking viewers if they plan to apply for the IPO and reminds them to like and subscribe to her channel. A disclaimer about the educational nature of her content and a warning against fraudulent stock tip advertisements follow.\n"

      "The video is an AI news roundup presented by Vinayakk Singhal. Here's a summary of the major AI updates and their implications:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. OpenAI's Sora 2 and its Valuation:**\n",
      "*   OpenAI has become the world's most valuable private company, valued at **$500 billion**, surpassing companies like SpaceX. This valuation is equivalent to the GDP of over 150 countries combined.\n",
      "*   The high valuation stems from a recent employee stock sale where $6.6 billion in shares were sold.\n",
      "*   OpenAI launched Sora 2, an AI video generator that creates videos with synchronized audio, accurate physics, and a built-in social app called Sora.\n",
      "*   Sora 2 allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos (cameos), fight dragons, do backflips, or even hang out in space.\n",
      "*   **Implications of Sora 2:**\n",
      "    *   **Marketing and Content Creation:** AI video tools, especially Sora 2, will dramatically reduce costs and time for product demos, ad campaigns, and fashion content by generating high-quality videos from text prompts without physical shoots.\n",
      "    *   **Filmmaking:** Directors can rapidly prototype entire scene concepts and test visual ideas before production, reducing the need for expensive storyboards and previews.\n",
      "    *   **Education:** Educators can visualize complex concepts, physics demonstrations, and historical recreations on demand. Medical researchers are already exploring its use for demonstrating surgical procedures.\n",
      "    *   **E-commerce:** Sellers can create professional-quality product shoots for impossible scenarios (e.g., pets using products, food sizzle reels, products in inaccessible environments) at a fraction of traditional costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Perplexity AI's Comet Browser:**\n",
      "*   Perplexity AI made its $200-per-month Comet browser entirely **free** worldwide.\n",
      "*   Comet is an AI-powered browser with a built-in assistant that can browse, compare, summarize, and even perform tasks like finding concert tickets and adding them to a cart.\n",
      "*   It also features a \"background assistant\" for Max plan subscribers, acting like a team of assistants to draft emails, find flights, and prepare meeting briefs simultaneously.\n",
      "*   **Implications:** This move challenges Google Chrome's dominance by competing on intelligence, not just speed, signaling the start of \"AI browser wars.\" Perplexity aims for market dominance rather than immediate profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Google DeepMind's Dreamer 4 in Minecraft:**\n",
      "*   Google DeepMind published a paper on Dreamer 4, an AI agent that learned to mine diamonds in Minecraft using **only offline data and imagination training**, without ever playing the actual game.\n",
      "*   Dreamer 4 watched 2500 hours of Minecraft videos, built an internal world model, and then practiced within its imagination to execute complex sequences of actions.\n",
      "*   It achieved diamond mining success in about 0.7% of its test runs, outperforming OpenAI's VTP offline agent, and runs smoothly on a single GPU.\n",
      "*   **Implications:** This is a significant step towards general-purpose robotics. Robots will be trained in simulated environments and imagination for millions of scenarios before executing tasks in reality, reducing the need for expensive real-world testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Anthropic's Claude Integration with Slack:**\n",
      "*   Anthropic integrated its Claude AI directly into Slack, making it accessible like a real person in any thread.\n",
      "*   Claude can prepare users for meetings by pulling relevant discussions, create documentation from scattered conversations, and draft responses to messages while respecting user permissions.\n",
      "*   For team and enterprise plans, Claude can summarize entire company Slack histories and integrate with Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Calendar.\n",
      "*   **Implications:** This will transform enterprise workflows, with some teams reporting a reduction in onboarding time from months to weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Microsoft's \"Vibe Working\" with Office Apps:**\n",
      "*   Microsoft announced \"Vibe Working\" for Office apps.\n",
      "*   **Agent Mode in Excel** can run complete financial analyses, create visualizations, and validate results iteratively by simply understanding natural language commands (e.g., \"analyze sales data and make it visual\").\n",
      "*   **Agent Mode in Word** turns writing into conversations, handling tasks like updating monthly reports with new data, finding emails, updating tables, and fixing formatting.\n",
      "*   **Office Agent in Copilot** (for PowerPoint and Word) uses Anthropic's Claude to create documents, while Agent Mode in Excel uses OpenAI's models.\n",
      "*   **Implications:** Microsoft is hedging its bets with multiple AI providers. While not yet perfect, AI's accuracy in these tasks is rapidly improving, indicating a significant shift in office productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Nothing's Essential Platform:**\n",
      "*   Nothing, the smartphone company, launched an AI platform that allows users to create apps by simply describing them.\n",
      "*   Users can describe functionalities like a wardrobe learning app or a receipt capture app, and the platform generates a \"widget\" for their home screen instantly.\n",
      "*   This platform, called the \"Nothing Playground,\" is a community hub where users can share, remix, and download AI-generated apps.\n",
      "*   **Implications:** This challenges the traditional app store concept by enabling users to create custom apps based on their specific needs. Nothing's CEO views this as a step towards an entirely AI-native operating system by 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Toyota's Woven City:**\n",
      "*   Toyota opened its **$10 billion Woven City** at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, with 300 residents already living there.\n",
      "*   It's a real town built to test future technology in everyday life, not just in labs.\n",
      "*   The city has three types of streets: one for autonomous vehicles, one for personal mobility (e-bikes), and one for pedestrians. Deliveries run through underground tunnels.\n",
      "*   Residents (mostly Toyota employees and researchers) are testing self-driving shuttles, delivery robots, smart homes with AI health monitoring, and hydrogen-powered infrastructure.\n",
      "*   **Implications:** This project is less about immediate profit and more about learning how humans interact with autonomous systems in real-life settings. This data is priceless for future AI and robotics development, making Woven City the first place where people can truly live in the future being tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rapid-Fire Updates:**\n",
      "*   **NotebookLM** got customizable chats and a learning guide feature to test understanding of materials.\n",
      "*   **Notion** launched a map view for organizing projects spatially.\n",
      "*   **XAI** is building \"Grokipedia,\" a Wikipedia-like platform powered by Grok AI for real-time, up-to-date information.\n",
      "*   **Google Researchers** released \"PASTA,\" an AI system that learns individual creative preferences through repeated interactions, reducing the need for complex prompt engineering.\n",
      "*   **Tencent's** open-source Hunyuan Image 3.0 moved to first place on LM Arena's text-to-image leaderboard, surpassing top closed-source options.\n",
      "*   **Anthropic** published research detailing Claude 4.5 Sonnet's cybersecurity capabilities, achieving top marks on industry benchmarks.\n",
      "*   **OpenAI** acquired personal finance startup **Roi**, with its CEO joining as an AI leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "*   All these updates happened in **one week**, not one quarter or one year.\n",
      "*   We are witnessing the fastest wealth creation and technology deployment in human history.\n",
      "*   The global economy is reorganizing around AI at an unprecedented speed.\n",
      "*   **What you should do:**\n",
      "    1.  **Stop waiting for things to stabilize; they won't.** Companies investing heavily in AI are planning for acceleration, not slowdown.\n",
      "    2.  **Focus on learning patterns, not specific tools.** Tools will change, but understanding how AI thinks, its strengths, and how to direct it will be the lasting skill.\n",
      "    3.  **Your competitive advantage is not knowing more than AI**, but knowing what to build with AI that nobody else has thought of yet.\n"

      "00:19 - 00:21 Microsoft brought out Vibe working.\n",
      "00:21 - 00:26 And Google's AI just learned to mine diamonds in Minecraft without ever playing the game.\n",
      "00:26 - 00:27 And there is much much more.\n",
      "00:27 - 00:30 Hello everyone, I'm Vinayakk Singhal, and you're watching.\n",
      "00:30 - 00:33 The Cutting Edge News. From new breakthroughs to bold experiments.\n",
      "00:33 - 00:37 Here are 12 AI updates shaping the world's biggest headlines.\n",
      "00:37 - 00:39 And trust me, you need to know them all.\n",
      "00:39 - 00:41 It's just been a week and the most crazy one.\n",
      "00:41 - 00:45 So without any further delay, let's start with OpenAI and Sora 2.\n",
      "00:45 - 00:49 Today, we're announcing the Sora app, powered by the all-new Sora 2.\n",
      "00:49 - 00:54 Well, that may look and sound just like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,\n",
      "00:54 - 00:58 but it's actually a video generated completely by AI.\n",
      "00:58 - 01:00 It's all powered by Sora 2.\n",
      "01:00 - 01:05 Now the clips are going viral, like one of CEO Sam Altman shoplifting GPUs.\n",
      "01:06 - 01:09 Please, I really need this for Sora inference. This video is too good.\n",
      "01:11 - 01:17 For those of you who missed the launch of Sora 2, it's the first AI video generator that creates videos with synchronized audio,\n",
      "01:17 - 01:20 accurate physics and a built-in social app.\n",
      "01:20 - 01:23 Like TikTok, every video is AI generated.\n",
      "01:23 - 01:25 The standout feature here is Cameos.\n",
      "01:25 - 01:31 You record yourself once, verify your identity and then you can insert yourself into any AI scene.\n",
      "01:31 - 01:36 Fighting dragons, doing backflips, hanging out in the space with your friends, everything's possible.\n",
      "01:36 - 01:39 But here's what this technology enables across different domains.\n",
      "01:39 - 01:42 First, marketing and content creation is being transformed.\n",
      "01:42 - 01:48 Early AI video tools have already shown dramatic productions and Sora 2 takes this further.\n",
      "01:48 - 01:56 Product demos that traditionally needed full camera crews, location shoots and editing teams can now be generated from text prompts.\n",
      "01:56 - 02:04 The physics accuracy means you can show products in motion, fabric flowing, liquids pouring, textures responding to light, all without a physical shoot.\n",
      "02:04 - 02:07 Second, filmmakers are using it for rapid prototyping.\n",
      "02:07 - 02:15 Instead of expensive previews or storyboards, directors can now generate entire scene concepts to test visual ideas before committing to production.\n",
      "02:15 - 02:22 Want to see how a zero gravity fight sequence might look, or a rain scene with specific lighting, generate it in minutes.\n",
      "02:22 - 02:24 Iterate, then shoot the real thing with confidence.\n",
      "02:24 - 02:28 Third, educators have a new visualization tool.\n",
      "02:28 - 02:38 Complex concepts that were previously limited to diagrams or expensive animations can now be brought to life, physics demonstrations, historical recreations, all can be generated on demand.\n",
      "02:38 - 02:46 Medical education researchers have already published papers exploring how the original Sora could demonstrate surgical procedures without operating rooms.\n",
      "02:46 - 02:50 Fourth, E-commerce sellers can solve impossible product shoots.\n",
      "02:50 - 02:59 Need to show a pet product in action, but your cat won't cooperate? Want food sizzle reels without waste? Need to demonstrate product in environments you can't access?\n",
      "02:59 - 03:02 AI video generation removes these physical constraints.\n",
      "03:02 - 03:07 Small businesses can now create professional quality content at a fraction of traditional costs.\n",
      "03:07 - 03:09 Now coming to the insane part.\n",
      "03:09 - 03:16 While OpenAI was launching Sora 2, it officially became the most valuable private company in the world at $500 billion valuation.\n",
      "03:16 - 03:17 Let me put that in perspective.\n",
      "03:17 - 03:22 SpaceX, the number two most valuable private company, is valued at $400 billion.\n",
      "03:22 - 03:25 OpenAI just overtook them.\n",
      "03:25 - 03:34 This happened after a recent employee stock sale where the company authorized employees to sell $10 billion in shares. Though shares worth only $6.6 billion were ultimately sold.\n",
      "03:34 - 03:36 But here's the wild part.\n",
      "03:36 - 03:41 That valuation means OpenAI is worth more than the GDP of 150 countries combined.\n",
      "03:41 - 03:42 Think about that for a second.\n",
      "03:42 - 03:49 A company that's less than 10 years old that makes a chatbot and some AI tools is now worth half a trillion dollars.\n",
      "03:49 - 03:59 OpenAI will reshape every industry, every workflow, every creative process. And based on what we are seeing with Sora 2 and the other updates this week, they might just be right.\n",
      "03:59 - 04:02 Speaking of massive moves, Perplexity just made one.\n",
      "04:02 - 04:06 Remember their Comet browser that cost $200 per month?\n",
      "04:06 - 04:08 They made it completely free.\n",
      "04:08 - 04:13 Comet is an AI powered browser with a built-in assistant that can actually browse for you.\n",
      "04:13 - 04:17 Need to compare insurance plans? Comet searches, compares and summarizes.\n",
      "04:17 - 04:21 Want to find the cheapest concert tickets? Comet adds them to your cart while you make a sandwich.\n",
      "04:21 - 04:27 The CEO said this can boost productivity so much that companies won't need to hire additional people.\n",
      "04:27 - 04:29 That's a bold claim, but here's what's real.\n",
      "04:29 - 04:34 Users who downloaded Comet increased their question asking by 6 to 18x on day one.\n",
      "04:34 - 04:43 For subscribers of the Max plan, which costs $200 a month, there's now a background assistant feature that works like having a team of assistants.\n",
      "04:43 - 04:49 You can tell it to draft your emails, find the best flights and prepare a meeting brief, all simultaneously in the background.\n",
      "04:49 - 04:52 Why does this matter?\n",
      "04:52 - 05:01 Google Chrome has dominated browsers for over a decade. Now we have AI-first browsers competing on intelligence, not just speed. This is the beginning of AI browser wars. And when a company makes a $200 product free,\n",
      "05:01 - 05:04 they're planning for market dominance, not profit.\n",
      "05:04 - 05:08 Now here is where things get really interesting.\n",
      "05:08 - 05:13 Google DeepMind just published a paper on Dreamer 4, and this is genuinely groundbreaking.\n",
      "05:13 - 05:22 Dreamer 4 became the first AI agent to mine diamonds in Minecraft using only offline data. It never played the actual game during training. Instead, it learned by imagining.\n",
      "05:22 - 05:24 Think about what this means.\n",
      "05:24 - 05:36 The AI watched 2,500 hours of Minecraft videos, built an internal world model, then practiced inside its own imagination until it could execute 20,000 plus consecutive actions to reach diamonds.\n",
      "05:36 - 05:40 Dreamer 4 managed to mine diamonds in about 0.7% of its test runs.\n",
      "05:40 - 05:52 That might sound small, but it's still ahead of OpenAI's VPT agent, an earlier AI trained on thousands of hours of Minecraft videos to imitate human players, which could not reach that milestone.\n",
      "05:52 - 05:57 Even more impressive, Dreamer 4 runs smoothly on a single GPU, far faster than older models.\n",
      "05:57 - 06:02 And this matters beyond gaming because this is exactly how we'll train robots in the future.\n",
      "06:02 - 06:78 Instead of expensive real world testing, robots will practice millions of scenarios in imagination, then execute in reality.\n",
      "06:07 - 06:11 This is the path to general purpose robotics.\n",
      "06:11 - 06:15 Anthropic just integrated Claude directly into Slack.\n",
      "06:15 - 06:17 This is a huge news for enterprise workflows.\n",
      "06:17 - 06:24 You can now mention Claude in any Slack thread as if a real person, DM it privately or use the AI assistant panel.\n",
      "06:24 - 06:33 Coming to the smart part, they also let you connect Slack to Claude, so when you're doing deep research in Claude, it can pull context from your Slack conversations and honestly, its use cases are wild.\n",
      "06:33 - 06:38 First, it can prepare you for meetings by pulling relevant discussions.\n",
      "06:38 - 06:44 Second, it can create documentation from scattered conversations. And third, it can even draft your responses to important messages.\n",
      "06:44 - 06:49 All while respecting your permission settings because it can only see what you see.\n",
      "06:49 - 06:53 For team and enterprise plans, this will transform how companies work.\n",
      "06:53 - 07:00 One team reported cutting onboarding time from months to weeks because Claude could instantly summarize the entire company's Slack history or any topic.\n",
      "07:00 - 07:03 Microsoft just announced Vibe Working.\n",
      "07:03 - 07:06 Their answer to Vibe coding, but only for office apps.\n",
      "07:06 - 07:13 Agent Mode in Excel can now run complete financial analysis, create visualizations and validate results iteratively.\n",
      "07:13 - 07:20 You just say analyze the sales data and make it visual. And it decides which formulas to use, creates new sheets and even builds charts.\n",
      "07:20 - 07:24 In Microsoft Word, Agent Mode turns writing into conversation.\n",
      "07:24 - 07:34 Tell it, update this monthly report into latest data from the September email and it handles everything, finding the email, updating tables and even fixing the format.\n",
      "07:34 - 07:36 But here is the twist.\n",
      "07:36 - 07:43 The office agent in Copilot uses Anthropic's Claude to create PowerPoint and Word docs. While Agent Mode uses OpenAI's models.\n",
      "07:43 - 07:46 Microsoft is hedging its best with multiple AI providers.\n",
      "07:46 - 07:54 The accuracy, Agent Mode scored 57.2% on spreadsheet benchmarks compared to 71.3% for human beings.\n",
      "07:54 - 07:56 Not perfect, but improving fast.\n",
      "07:56 - 08:00 Nothing's Essential platform just dropped and this is wild.\n",
      "08:00 - 08:11 The smartphone company launched an AI platform that lets you create apps just by describing them. Want an app that captures receipts from your camera roll and exports a finance ready PDF every Friday, just say it.\n",
      "08:11 - 08:17 Want to mood tracker that syncs with the music playlist, done, it generates these as widgets you can add to your home screen instantly.\n",
      "08:17 - 08:24 And they're calling it the Nothing Playground, a community hub where you can share, remix and download apps created by others.\n",
      "08:24 - 08:32 CEO Carl Pei says that this is the first step towards building an entirely AI native operating system by 2027.\n",
      "08:32 - 08:41 Currently available only on Nothing phones, but this challenges the entire concept of App stores. Why download pre-made apps when AI can build exactly what you need?\n",
      "08:41 - 08:43 Another very interesting news.\n",
      "08:43 - 08:52 Toyota just opened its $10 billion Woven City at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan. And 300 residents are already living there as of October 2025.\n",
      "08:52 - 08:57 This is not just a simulation, it's a real town built to test future technology in everyday life.\n",
      "08:57 - 09:06 The streets are split into three zones, one for autonomous vehicles, one for personal mobility like e-bikes and one for purely pedestrians.\n",
      "09:06 - 09:10 All deliveries run through underground tunnels carved into volcanic rocks.\n",
      "09:10 - 09:20 Residents, mostly Toyota employees and researchers are testing self-driving shuttles, delivery robots, smart homes with AI health monitoring and hydrogen powered everything.\n",
      "09:20 - 09:28 But here's the key, it's not just about the tech, it's about how homes, mobility, logistics and energy systems connect and evolve based on how people actually live.\n",
      "09:28 - 09:32 Toyota invested $10 billion knowing this might never make them money.\n",
      "09:32 - 09:40 But they're betting that learning how humans interact with autonomous systems in real life, not in labs, but while living, walking, working, that data is priceless.\n",
      "09:40 - 09:47 This is the first place where you can actually live in the future being tested, not on paper, but in reality.\n",
      "09:47 - 09:52 Just thinking about living in such a place in India gives me goosebumps.\n",
      "09:52 - 09:54 Tell me what you think about it.\n",
      "09:54 - 09:58 Now, it's time to shift gears for a quick rapid fire round up of this week's biggest AI updates.\n",
      "09:58 - 10:04 NotebookLM got customizable chats and a learning guide feature which will test and deepen your understanding of your materials.\n",
      "10:04 - 10:08 Notion launched map view, finally a spatial way to organize your projects.\n",
      "10:08 - 10:15 xAI is building Grokipedia, basically Wikipedia powered by Grok AI for real-time up-to-date information.\n",
      "10:15 - 10:27 Google researchers released Pasta, an AI system that adapts to individual creative preferences through repeated interactions, learning what visual styles users actually want rather than requiring complex prompt engineering.\n",
      "10:27 - 10:36 Tencent open sourced Hunyuan Image 3.0 model move to first place on LMArena's text to image leaderboard, surpassing top closed options.\n",
      "10:36 - 10:45 Anthropic published research detailing Claude 4.5 Sonnet's cyber security capabilities with the new model achieving top marks on industry benchmarks.\n",
      "10:45 - 10:51 OpenAI acquired personal finance startup Roy with CEO Sujit Vishwajit joining as the AI leader in the deal.\n",
      "10:51 - 10:56 Now here's what connects all of this. We're witnessing the fastest wealth creation in human history alongside the fastest technology deployment.\n",
      "10:56 - 11:01 OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation.\n",
      "11:01 - 11:04 They use that to build Sora 2. Sora 2 creates a new social platform.\n",
      "11:04 - 11:10 Now we're moving from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator to AI as an autonomous worker.\n",
      "11:10 - 11:19 And here's what nobody is talking about. Every single one of these updates happened in one week, not one quarter, not one year, one week.\n",
      "11:19 - 11:34 When a technology company becomes worth more than most countries economies in less than a decade and when that same week they release tools that can imagine, browse, collaborate and create autonomously, we're not watching incremental progress anymore, we're watching exponential transformation.\n",
      "11:34 - 11:36 So what should you do?\n",
      "11:36 - 11:46 First, stop waiting for things to stabilize. They won't. The companies betting half a trillion dollars on AI aren't playing for this to slow down. They're planning for it to accelerate.\n",
      "11:46 - 11:57 Second, focus on learning patterns, not specific tools. The tools will change every now and then, but understanding how AI thinks, what it's good at, and how to direct it, that's the lasting skill.\n",
      "11:57 - 12:10 Third, remember when AI makes a company worth $500 billion and enables tools that work autonomously, your competitive advantage isn't knowing more than AI. It's knowing what to build with AI that nobody else has thought of yet.\n",
      "12:10 - 12:18 This week, OpenAI became the world's most valuable private company at $500 billion valuation, worth more than 150 countries combined.\n",
      "12:18 - 12:21 They launched Sora 2 with social features and accurate physics.\n",
      "12:21 - 12:23 Perplexity made Comet browser free.\n",
      "12:23 - 12:26 Dreamer 4 mastered Minecraft through imagination.\n",
      "12:26 - 12:28 Claude integrated with Slack.\n",
      "12:28 - 12:30 Microsoft introduced Vibe Working.\n",
      "12:30 - 12:33 And about six other major updates. The pattern, we're not just seeing AI improve.\n",
      "12:33 - 12:40 We're seeing the entire global economy reorganized around it at unprecedented speed.\n",

      "- **00:50 - 00:54**: Well that may look and sound just like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,\n",
      "- **00:54 - 00:59**: but it's actually a video generated completely by AI.\n",
      "- **00:59 - 01:00**: It's all powered by Sora 2.\n",
      "- **01:00 - 01:02**: Now the clips are going viral,\n",
      "- **01:02 - 01:05**: like one of CEO Sam Altman shoplifting GPUs.\n",
      "- **01:05 - 01:09**: Please, I really need this for Sora inference. This video is too good.\n",
      "- **01:11 - 01:12**: For those of you who missed the launch of\n",
      "- **01:12 - 01:13**: OpenAI's launch of Sora 2 and its use cases\n",
      "- **01:12 - 01:13**: Sora 2\n",
      "- **01:13 - 01:18**: Sora 2, it's the first AI video generator that creates videos with synchronized audio, accurate physics, and some anime.\n",
      "- **01:18 - 01:19**: Physics with Sora 2\n",
      "- **01:19 - 01:20**: and a built-in social app.\n",
      "- **01:20 - 01:23**: Like TikTok, every video is AI generated.\n",
      "- **01:23 - 01:24**: The standout feature here is Cameos.\n",
      "- **01:24 - 01:25**: Start recording and say the numbers on screen\n",
      "- **01:25 - 01:26**: Start recording\n",
      "- **01:26 - 01:35**: You record yourself once, verify your identity, and then you can insert yourself into any AI scene. Fighting dragons, doing backflips, hanging out in the space with your friends. Everything's possible.\n",
      "- **01:36 - 01:39**: But here's what this technology enables across different domains.\n",
      "- **01:39 - 01:42**: 1. Marketing and content creation is being transformed\n",
      "- **01:42 - 01:44**: his art style to create something new!\n",
      "- **01:44 - 01:48**: Early AI video tools have already shown dramatic productions and Sora 2 takes this further.\n",
      "- **01:48 - 01:56**: Product demos that traditionally needed full camera crews, location shoots and editing teams can now be generated from text prompts.\n",
      "- **01:56 - 02:04**: The physics accuracy means you can show products in motion, fabric flowing, liquids pouring, textures responding to light, all without a physical shoot.\n",
      "- **02:04 - 02:07**: 2. Filmmakers are using it for rapid prototyping\n",
      "- **02:07 - 02:15**: Instead of expensive previews or storyboards, directors can now generate entire scene concepts to test visual ideas before committing to production.\n",
      "- **02:15 - 02:21**: Want to see how a zero gravity fight sequence might look, or a rain scene with specific lighting?\n",
      "- **02:21 - 02:24**: Generate it in minutes, iterate, then shoot the real thing with confidence.\n",
      "- **02:24 - 02:27**: 3. Educators have a new visualization tool\n",
      "- **02:27 - 02:38**: Complex concepts that were previously limited to diagrams or expensive animations can now be brought to life. Physics demonstrations, historical recreations, all can be generated on demand.\n",
      "- **02:38 - 02:46**: Medical education researchers have already published papers exploring how the original Sora could demonstrate surgical procedures without operating rooms.\n",
      "- **02:46 - 02:49**: 4. E-commerce sellers can solve impossible product shoots\n",
      "- **02:49 - 03:02**: Need to show a pet product in action, but your cat won't cooperate? Want food sizzle reels without waste? Need to demonstrate products in environments you can't access? AI video generation removes these physical constraints.\n",
      "- **03:02 - 03:07**: Small businesses can now create professional quality content at a fraction of traditional costs.\n",
      "- **03:07 - 03:09**: Now coming to the insane part.\n",
      "- **03:09 - 03:16**: While OpenAI was launching Sora 2, it officially became the most valuable private company in the world, valued at $500 billion.\n",
      "- **03:16 - 03:17**: Let me put that in perspective.\n",
      "- **03:18 - 03:22**: SpaceX, the number two most valuable private company is valued at $400 billion.\n",
      "- **03:22 - 03:25**: OpenAI just overtook them.\n",
      "- **03:25 - 03:30**: This happened after a recent employee stock sale, where the company authorized employees to sell $10 billion in shares,\n",
      "- **03:30 - 03:34**: though shares worth only $6.6 billion were ultimately sold.\n",
      "- **03:34 - 03:36**: But here's the wild part.\n",
      "- **03:36 - 03:41**: That valuation means OpenAI is worth more than the GDP of 150 countries combined.\n",
      "- **03:41 - 03:43**: Think about that for a second.\n",
      "- **03:43 - 03:49**: A company that's less than 10 years old, that makes a chatbot and some AI tools is now worth half a trillion dollars.\n",
      "- **03:49 - 03:54**: OpenAI will reshape every industry, every workflow, every creative process.\n",
      "- **03:54 - 03:59**: And based on what we are seeing with Sora 2 and the other updates this week, they might just be right.\n",
      "- **03:59 - 04:02**: Speaking of massive moves, Perplexity just made one.\n",
      "- **04:02 - 04:03**: Perplexity's Comet browser is now free for everyone\n",
      "- **04:03 - 04:05**: Remember their Comet browser that cost $200 per month?\n",
      "- **04:05 - 04:07**: They made it completely free.\n",
      "- **04:07 - 04:09**: Comet is an AI powered browser with a built-in assistant\n",
      "- **04:09 - 04:13**: that can actually browse for you. Need to compare insurance plans?\n",
      "- **04:13 - 04:17**: Comet searches, compares and summarizes.\n",
      "- **04:17 - 04:22**: Want to find the cheapest concert tickets? Comet adds them to your cart while you make a sandwich.\n",
      "- **04:22 - 04:27**: The CEO said this can boost productivity so much that companies won't need to hire additional people.\n",
      "- **04:27 - 04:29**: That's a bold claim, but here's what's real.\n",
      "- **04:29 - 04:35**: Users who downloaded Comet increased their question asking by 6 to 18X on day one.\n",
      "- **04:35 - 04:49**: For subscribers of the Max plan, which costs $200 a month, there's now a background assistant feature that works like having a team of assistants. You can tell it to draft your emails, find the best flights, and prepare a meeting brief, all simultaneously in the background.\n",
      "- **04:49 - 04:52**: Why does this matter? Google Chrome has dominated browsers for over a decade.\n",
      "- **04:52 - 04:57**: Now we have AI first browsers competing on intelligence, not just speed.\n",
      "- **04:57 - 05:05**: This is the beginning of AI browser wars, and when a company makes a $200 product free, they're planning for market dominance, not profit.\n",
      "- **05:05 - 05:07**: Now here is where things get really interesting.\n",
      "- **05:07 - 05:09**: Google DeepMind just published a paper on Dreamer 4,\n",
      "- **05:09 - 05:12**: and this is genuinely groundbreaking.\n",
      "- **05:12 - 05:22**: Dreamer 4 became the first AI agent to mine diamonds in Minecraft using only offline data. It never played the actual game during training, instead it learned by imagining.\n",
      "- **05:22 - 05:23**: Think about what this means.\n",
      "- **05:23 - 05:36**: The AI watched 2500 hours of Minecraft videos, built an internal world model, then practiced inside its own imagination until it could execute 20,000 plus consecutive actions to reach diamonds.\n",
      "- **05:36 - 05:40**: Dreamer 4 managed to mine diamonds in about 0.7% of its test runs.\n",
      "- **05:40 - 05:46**: That might sound small, but it's still ahead of OpenAI's VPT agent, an earlier AI trained on thousands of hours of Minecraft videos to imitate human players,\n",
      "- **05:46 - 05:51**: which could not reach that milestone.\n",
      "- **05:51 - 05:58**: Even more impressive, Dreamer 4 runs smoothly on a single GPU, far faster than older models.\n",
      "- **05:58 - 06:12**: And this matters beyond gaming, because this is exactly how we'll train robots in the future. Instead of expensive real-world testing, robots will practice millions of scenarios in imagination, then execute in reality. This is the part to general purpose robotics.\n",
      "- **06:12 - 06:15**: Anthropic just integrated Claude directly into Slack.\n",
      "- **06:15 - 06:17**: This is huge news for enterprise workflows.\n",
      "- **06:17 - 06:24**: You can now mention Claude in any Slack thread as if a real person. DM it privately or use the AI assistant panel.\n",
      "- **06:24 - 06:34**: Coming to the smart part, they also let you connect Slack to Claude. So when you're doing deep research in Claude, it can pull context from your Slack conversations and honestly, its use cases are wild.\n",
      "- **06:34 - 06:37**: First it can prepare you for meetings by pulling relevant discussions.\n",
      "- **06:37 - 06:44**: Second it can create documentation from scattered conversations. And third, it can even draft your responses to important messages.\n",
      "- **06:44 - 06:49**: All while respecting your permission settings because it can only see what you see.\n",
      "- **06:49 - 06:54**: For team and enterprise plans, this will transform how companies work.\n",
      "- **06:54 - 07:00**: One team reported cutting onboarding time from months to weeks because Claude could instantly summarize the entire company's Slack history or any topic.\n",
      "- **07:00 - 07:04**: Microsoft just announced Vibe Working.\n",
      "- **07:04 - 07:06**: Their answer to Vibe Coding, but only for office apps.\n",
      "- **07:06 - 07:20**: Agent Mode in Excel can now run complete financial analysis, create visualizations, and validate results iteratively. You just say analyze the sales data and make it visual, and it decides which formulas to use, creates new sheets, and even builds charts.\n",
      "- **07:20 - 07:24**: In Microsoft Word, Agent Mode turns writing into conversation.\n",
      "- **07:24 - 07:34**: Tell it update this monthly report into latest data from the September email, and it handles everything. Finding the email, updating tables, and even fixing the format.\n",
      "- **07:34 - 07:36**: But here is the twist.\n",
      "- **07:36 - 07:43**: The office agent in Copilot uses Anthropic's Claude to create PowerPoint and Word docs, while Agent Mode uses OpenAI's models.\n",
      "- **07:43 - 07:46**: Microsoft is hedging its best with multiple AI providers.\n",
      "- **07:46 - 07:54**: The accuracy, Agent Mode scored 57.2% on spreadsheet benchmarks compared to 71.3% for human beings.\n",
      "- **07:54 - 07:56**: Not perfect, but improving fast.\n",
      "- **07:56 - 07:59**: Nothing's Essential platform just dropped, and this is wild.\n",
      "- **07:59 - 08:14**: The smartphone company launched an AI platform that lets you create apps just by describing them. Want an app that captures receipts from your camera roll and exports a finance ready PDF every Friday? Just say it. Want a mood tracker that syncs with a music playlist? Done.\n",
      "- **08:14 - 08:24**: It generates these as widgets. You can add to your home screen instantly. And they're calling it the Nothing Playground, a community hub where you can share, remix, and download apps created by others.\n",
      "- **08:24 - 08:32**: CEO Carl Pei says that this is the first step towards building an entirely AI native operating system by 2027.\n",
      "- **08:32 - 08:38**: Currently available only on Nothing phones, but this challenges the entire concept of App Stores.\n",
      "- **08:38 - 08:41**: Why download pre-made apps when AI can build exactly what you need?\n",
      "- **08:41 - 08:43**: Another very interesting news.\n",
      "- **08:43 - 08:50**: Toyota just opened its $10 billion Woven City at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, and 300 residents are already living there as of October 2025.\n",
      "- **08:50 - 08:57**: This is not just a simulation, it's a real town built to test future technology in everyday life.\n",
      "- **08:57 - 09:06**: The streets are split into three zones. One for autonomous vehicles, one for personal mobility like e-bikes, and one for purely pedestrians.\n",
      "- **09:06 - 09:10**: All deliveries run through underground tunnels carved into volcanic rocks.\n",
      "- **09:10 - 09:19**: Residents, mostly Toyota employees and researchers, are testing self-driving shuttles, delivery robots, smart homes with AI health monitoring and hydrogen powered everything.\n",
      "- **09:19 - 09:28**: But here's the key: it's not just about the tech, it's about how homes, mobility, logistics and energy systems connect and evolve based on how people actually live.\n",
      "- **09:28 - 09:32**: Toyota invested $10 billion knowing this might never make them money.\n",
      "- **09:32 - 09:40**: But they're betting that learning how humans interact with autonomous systems in real life, not in labs, but while living, walking, working, that data is priceless.\n",
      "- **09:40 - 09:47**: This is the first place where you can actually live in the future being tested. Not on paper, but in reality.\n",
      "- **09:47 - 09:52**: Just thinking about living in such a place in India gives me goosebumps. Tell me what you think about it.\n",
      "- **09:52 - 09:57**: Now it's time to shift gears for a quick rapid fire round up of this week's biggest AI updates.\n",
      "- **09:57 - 10:04**: Notebook LM got customizable chats and a learning guide feature which will test and deepen your understanding of your materials.\n",
      "- **10:04 - 10:08**: Notion launched Map View. Finally, a spatial way to organize your projects.\n",
      "- **10:08 - 10:15**: xAI is building Grokipiedia, basically Wikipedia powered by Grok AI for real-time, up-to-date information.\n",
      "- **10:15 - 10:27**: Google researchers released PASTA, an AI system that adapts to individual creative preferences through repeated interactions, learning what visual styles users actually want rather than requiring complex prompt engineering.\n",
      "- **10:27 - 10:36**: Tencent's open source Hunyuan Image 3.0 model moved to first place on LMArena's text to image leaderboard, surpassing top closed options.\n",
      "- **10:36 - 10:44**: Anthropic published research detailing Claude 4.5 Sonnet's cybersecurity capabilities, with the new model achieving top marks on industry benchmarks.\n",
      "- **10:44 - 10:50**: OpenAI acquired personal finance startup Roy with CEO Sujith Vishwajit joining as the AI leader in the deal.\n",
      "- **10:50 - 10:57**: Now here's what connects all of this. We're witnessing the fastest wealth creation in human history, alongside the fastest technology deployment.\n",
      "- **10:57 - 11:01**: OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation.\n",
      "- **11:01 - 11:02**: They used that to build Sora 2.\n",
      "- **11:02 - 11:05**: Sora 2 creates a new social platform.\n",
      "- **11:05 - 11:10**: Now we're moving from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator to AI as an autonomous worker.\n",
      "- **11:10 - 11:14**: And here's what nobody is talking about. Every single one of these updates happened in one week.\n",
      "- **11:14 - 11:18**: Not one quarter, not one year, one week.\n",
      "- **11:18 - 11:34**: When a technology company becomes worth more than most country's economies in less than a decade, and when that same week they release tools that can imagine, browse, collaborate and create autonomously, we're not watching incremental progress anymore, we're watching exponential transformation.\n",
      "- **11:34 - 11:36**: So what should you do?\n",
      "- **11:36 - 11:46**: First, stop waiting for things to stabilize. They won't. The companies betting half a trillion dollars on AI aren't playing for this to slow down, they're planning for it to accelerate.\n",
      "- **11:46 - 11:57**: Second, focus on learning patterns, not specific tools. The tools will change every now and then, but understanding how AI thinks, what it's good at, and how to direct it, that's the lasting skill.\n",
      "- **11:57 - 12:10**: Third, remember when AI makes a company worth $500 billion and enables tools that work autonomously, your competitive advantage isn't knowing more than AI, it's knowing what to build with AI that nobody else has thought of yet.\n",
      "- **12:10 - 12:18**: This week OpenAI became the world's most valuable private company at $500 billion valuation, worth more than 150 countries combined.\n",
      "- **12:18 - 12:21**: They launched Sora 2 with social features and accurate physics.\n",

      "- **12:28 - 12:33**: Microsoft introduced Vibe Working and about six other major updates.\n",
      "- **12:33 - 12:40**: The pattern, we are not just seeing AI improve, we are seeing the entire global economy reorganize around it at unprecedented speed.\n",
      "- **12:40 - 12:43**: This is Vinayak, and you're watching The Cutting Edge News.\n"

      "Here's a breakdown of similarities, differences, and matching scenes:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Similarities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Format:** Both videos feature a male instructor speaking directly to the camera, intercut with animated or graphical explanations and occasional stock footage/movie clips.\n",
      "*   **Instructional Tone:** Both videos aim to educate the viewer on specific topics (finance and career) and provide actionable advice.\n",
      "*   **Language:** Both videos are presented in Hindi, targeting an Indian audience.\n",
      "*   **Visual Aids:** Both instructors use a whiteboard/large paper to write down key points and examples, making the information easier to follow.\n",
      "*   **Encouragement for Engagement:** Both videos conclude with a call to action for comments and likes, and emphasize the value of continuous learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Topic:** The first video (00:00-01:05:41) focuses on **financial rules and planning**, covering car buying, house buying, insurance, investment strategies, and budgeting. The second video (00:00-00:08:54) focuses on the **changing landscape of tech hiring and career development**, particularly for entry-level software engineers.\n",
      "*   **Instructor:** While both instructors are male, they are different individuals with distinct presenting styles.\n",
      "*   **Visual Aesthetics (Main Set):** The first video has a more stylized set with specific lighting (a large, round light on the left) and a large screen displaying nature scenes in the background. The second video's set is more office-like, with wooden panels and bookshelves.\n",
      "*   **Specific Rules/Advice:** The content of the advice is entirely different, tailored to their respective topics. For example, the first video discusses the \"20/4/10-50 rule\" for car buying, while the second discusses the importance of Cloud, DevOps, and AI for interns.\n",
      "*   **Tone/Urgency:** The second video has a slightly more urgent and critical tone when discussing the current challenges in the tech job market (\"New norm in Tech hiring,\" \"Why is the Tech Market like this?\").\n",
      "\n",
      "**Matching Scenes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **00:00 - 00:00:09 (Video 1) vs. 00:00 - 00:00:13 (Video 2):** Both videos start with the instructor directly addressing the audience, setting the stage for the topic to be discussed. They both use hand gestures to emphasize their points.\n",
      "*   **00:10 - 00:16 (Video 1):** The instructor points to a list of rules written on a virtual whiteboard, providing an overview of what will be covered. This is a common setup also seen in the second video's explanation style.\n",
      "*   **00:50 - 00:58 (Video 1):** The instructor uses a physical whiteboard to write down the \"20/4/10-50\" car buying rule. This visual aid technique is used throughout the first video and is similar in concept to how the second video presents its key points via text on screen or a physical whiteboard.\n",
      "*   **00:59 - 01:00 (Video 1) & 03:32 - 03:33 (Video 1) vs. 00:03 - 00:06 (Video 2):** Both videos use stock footage or animated clips to illustrate points. The first video shows an animated family with money falling, then people looking at cars, and a family entering a house. The second video shows people working on laptops in a collaborative environment.\n",
      "*   **02:29 - 02:34 (Video 1) & 03:25 - 03:31 (Video 1) & 07:04 - 07:12 (Video 1):** The instructor uses hand gestures, including the \"OK\" sign and open palms, to emphasize understanding or agreement. The second video's instructor also frequently uses similar hand gestures.\n",
      "*   **08:24 - 08:29 (Video 1) vs. 00:10 - 00:12 (Video 2):** Both instructors make a point about how quickly things change over time (\"with time\" vs. \"aaj ekdam change ho gaya hai\").\n",
      "*   **08:44 - 08:55 (Video 1) vs. 00:14 - 00:20 (Video 2) & 00:25 - 00:42 (Video 2) & 02:07 - 02:11 (Video 2):** Both videos use screen recordings of job descriptions/insurance websites to show real-world examples.\n",

      "And then what is life's good? That's nothing but the slogan of their company. Well, is life really good or not everyone has to check that for themselves. But is the IPO good or not? If you want to know the answer for this, you'll have to check out the full video. And just in case if you feel that I know a lot about this company, just check if you know the answers to these three questions. Number one, what will be the impact of Trump tariffs on the company? Number two, has LG gained market share or lost market share in the last few years? And number three, is the company overvalued or undervalued? Before we move on, a quick update on my Har Ghar Investor Hyderabad event. I'm getting so many requests to extend the early bird offer. So, finally, today will be the last day for the early bird offer. If you check, a lot of seats have already been booked. In this seminar, I'm going to specifically focus on how AI can be used on fundamental analysis. I'm going to talk about my NIFTY target. And very important, in this entire seminar, there's going to be a separate section which is going to be a Q&A section where you can ask your questions directly to me. Seats are filling up fast. Early bird offer ends today. So, hurry up and check out the link in the pinned comment and in the description box below. All right, now let's get started with the basics as to what does the company do, right? LG Electronics India Limited is mainly engaged in what? Manufacturing and sale of what? Of home appliances, air solutions and home entertainment. But I'm sure you might be like, what all things are included in this? Now, if I look at the first point, which is home appliances and air solutions. It includes something like refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, water purifiers, air purifiers, dishwashers, microwave ovens, compressors, motors, whatever, right? So, this is simple. Home appliances and air solutions, of course, it will be something like air conditioner, air purifier, whatever. Now, if I go to the second segment, it's home entertainment. And in that, it's mainly televisions and audio devices. And if it's about a B2B business, then it's about projectors, monitors, and all that as well. So, I hope you have understood two things here. They have two product segments, two product lines. One is home appliances and air solutions in which we have something like uh washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, microwave ovens, whatever. And in home entertainment\n"
